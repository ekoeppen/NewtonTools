*	File fenv.h - ARM x00 version,							
*													 
*	A collection of functions designed to provide access to the floating	
*	point environment for numerical programming. It is modeled after the 
*	Numerical C Extensions Group’s requirements ( NCEG / X3J11.1 ).	
*													 *
*	The file <fenv.h> declares many functions in support of numerical
*	programming.  It provides a set of environmental controls similar to
*	the ones found in <SANE.h>.  Programs that test flags or run under
*	non-default modes must do so under the effect of an enabling	
*	"fenv_access" pragma.								
*												
*	Note that the rounding mode maskes are dummies, because ARM has round  
*	bits in each instruction.
