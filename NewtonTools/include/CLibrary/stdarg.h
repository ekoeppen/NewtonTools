/********** Apple CFront USERS PLEASE NOTE! **********/
/* CFront doesn't accept expressions of the form ((struct foo {int x;}*) 0)->x.

	Solution:  In your code, somewhere before you say "va_arg(x, Type);"
				you must say "va_hack(Type);".
	Nasty side:  For the hack to work, Type must be a single word.  So, for
				example, if your list is a list of pointers, you can not
				say va_hack(MyStruct*).  You must define MyStructPtr and
				then you may successfully utter va_hack(MyStructPtr).

	Example:

	Boolean RSect(Rect *minRect, short count, Rect *r1, ...)
	{
		typedef Rect* RectPtr;

		RectPtr		curRectPtr;
		va_list		args;

		va_start(args, r1);

		if (condition to quit early) {
			va_end(args);
			return(false);
		}

		for (count--; count > 0; count--) {
			va_hack(RectPtr);
			curRectPtr = va_arg(args, RectPtr);
		}

		va_end(args);
		return(true);
	}
