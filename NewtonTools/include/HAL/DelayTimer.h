	Contains:	DelayTimer implements a fast timer polling service based on the timer0
				free-running timer. Also includes a useful global routine for
				one-shot delays...

	Derived from v2 (11/18/94) internal

	Notes:

				UNLESS YOU ARE IN THE ROM, use ConvertToHardwareTime() to generate values
				to pass to the delay routines. This will ensure that you continue to
				work on future platforms (like Voyager-based Newton's) where the hardware
				time base is different.

				Use only for short delays (remember, no polling!).

				Polled timer handling routines. 2 varieties of timer routines are provided:

				1. Busy wait a specified time: call ShortTimerDelay.

				2. Busy wait while looking for some event (e.g., waiting for some SCC register bit to
				   change. Call ResetTimeOut at the start, then call TimedOut as needed to see if the
				   time has expired. Right now this kind of call can't be nested: it would be easy to
				   support nested calls: the caller would simply be responsible for remembering the start
				   time and delay, and passing these to the routine (could be an object).

				The timeout routines are typically called with interrupts disabled! Timing will be less
					exact, otherwise...

	//   uses THardwareTimeUnits to be fast; the client can use ConvertToHardwareTime
	//   in an initialization routine to create various hardware time value constants
	//	 to be used later. Conversely, if GetHardwareTime() is used in a time-critical
	//   situation (e.g., performance monitors), ConvertFromHardwareTime can be
	//   used later to translate into platform-independent times. These routines can
	//   also be used to generate factors to do your own conversion: e.g.,
	//	 (1*kMilliseconds)/ConvertToHardwareTime(1*kMilliseconds) is the factor to multiply
	//   THardwareTimeUnits's by to get TTimeout's.
